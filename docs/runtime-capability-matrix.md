# Runtime capability matrix

Per-language conformance to `docs/frame_runtime.md` (the v4 runtime
spec). Generated from a manual audit on 2026-04-26.

## Legend

- ✅ — fully implemented per spec
- ⚠️ — implemented with a known limitation (footnote)
- ❌ — not implemented; spec divergence
- 🚫 — language-natural skip (feature doesn't apply, e.g. async on a
  one-color language)

## Footnotes

[a] **Erlang** — built on `gen_statem` (OTP) instead of a custom
    kernel. The shape is different (state functions, not a router),
    but the semantic surface (`@@:return`, `@@:data`, lifecycle
    routing, transitions) is mapped onto the platform.

[b] **Erlang** — domain fields live on the `#data{}` record threaded
    through `gen_statem` callbacks. Reads/writes look like
    `Data#data.x` rather than `self.x`.

[c] **Erlang** — exit args populate `frame_exit_args` on the data
    record, but `frame_exit_dispatch__` is currently a no-op
    placeholder. The data is captured but no `<$` handler ever
    runs — see [d].

[d] **Erlang** — `gen_statem`'s `state_enter` mode fires `enter` on
    the *leaf* state only when transitioning, and there is no
    corresponding state-exit callback. The runtime-spec cascade
    (parent's `$>` runs top-down on entry; child's `<$` runs
    bottom-up on exit) is **not implemented**. Tracked as future
    work; existing Erlang HSM tests are smoke tests that don't
    assert ordering, so they continue to pass.

    Forward transitions (`-> =>`) similarly leave `forward_event`
    on the destination but don't re-dispatch it through a cascade
    — only the leaf's handler sees the forwarded event.

[f] **Java** — Frame async lowers to `CompletableFuture` in
    principle but isn't fully wired (`make_system_async` has a
    placeholder for Java). Existing Java tests don't exercise async.

[g] **Go** — async goroutines aren't supported via `@@async`;
    Go's concurrency model is goroutines + channels, which doesn't
    map cleanly onto the kernel-callback structure framec uses.
    Tests skip with `@@skip -- go is one-color`.

[h] **Erlang** — actor model + selective receive replaces async/await;
    "one-color" in the same sense as Go. Async tests skip.

[i] **Erlang** — the self-call transition guard is implemented via
    `gen_statem`'s native state-machine semantics rather than the
    `_transitioned` flag the other 16 backends use. After
    `frame_dispatch__`, generated code wraps the post-call
    statements in a `case Data#data.frame_current_state of
    <pre-call-state> -> [post-call code]; _ -> {next_state, ...}
    end` short-circuit. Functional contract identical (post-call
    code does not run after a transitioning self-call); structurally
    divergent (no `_transitioned` flag, no
    `if _context_stack[-1]._transitioned: return` shape).
    Implemented in `erlang_wrap_self_call_guards`
    (`framec/.../erlang_system.rs:1411-1589`); codegen's
    `generate_self_call_guard` returns empty for Erlang
    (`framec/.../frame_expansion.rs:4752`). The divergence is
    intentional — keeping `gen_statem` idioms is preferred over
    structural sameness. See `docs/erlang_alignment_requirements.md`
    in the framepiler repo for the path-to-alignment if structural
    consistency becomes a requirement.

## Summary

| Bucket | Conformance |
|---|---|
| Languages fully conformant to v4 spec | 16 / 17 (all except Erlang) |
| Languages with HSM cascade implemented | 16 / 17 |
| Known divergence | Erlang HSM cascade ([d]); Erlang self-call guard mechanism ([i], functional contract still met) |
| Language-natural skips | C, Go, PHP, Ruby, Lua, Erlang on async |

## Test corpus coverage

Every capability marked ✅ above is exercised by an executable test
under `tests/common/positive/`. The matrix-runner enforces these
across every language at every commit; see `make test` from
`docker/`.

The cascade tests (46–48), parameter-propagation test (49), and the
HSM state-arg propagation test (52) are the canonical conformance
gates for the HSM additions in v4. Erlang's versions of these are
smoke-test stand-ins (verify the system runs, log contains expected
strings) rather than ordering assertions, since the underlying
`gen_statem` runtime can't satisfy the spec without a substantial
rewrite of `frame_transition__`.

## Footnotes

[a] **Erlang** — built on `gen_statem` (OTP) instead of a custom
    kernel. The shape is different (state functions, not a router),
    but the semantic surface (`@@:return`, `@@:data`, lifecycle
    routing, transitions) is mapped onto the platform.

[b] **Erlang** — domain fields live on the `#data{}` record threaded
    through `gen_statem` callbacks. Reads/writes look like
    `Data#data.x` rather than `self.x`.

[c] **Erlang** — exit args populate `frame_exit_args` on the data
    record. `frame_exit_dispatch__` walks the HSM chain bottom-up
    and calls each layer's `frame_exit__<state>` helper, so child
    `<$` handlers fire and receive their declared params via
    positional extraction from the args map.

[f] **Java** — async-typed interface methods return
    `CompletableFuture<T>`, with bodies wrapping their result via
    `.completedFuture(...)`. The internal dispatch chain stays
    synchronous (the constructor fires the start-state's `$>`
    cascade directly, since two-phase init buys nothing on a
    sync runtime). Users `.get()` at the interface boundary.
    Implementation is `make_java_interface_async` in
    `framec_native_codegen/system_codegen.rs`. An `init()` method
    is also emitted for cross-language API parity (callers can
    write `system.init().get()` portably) — its body is a no-op
    completed-future, since the constructor already drove
    initialization. Tested by
    `tests/java/positive/async_basic.fjava` and
    `tests/common/positive/demos/19_async_http_client.fjava`.

[g] **Go** — async goroutines aren't supported via `@@async`;
    Go's concurrency model is goroutines + channels, which doesn't
    map cleanly onto the kernel-callback structure framec uses.
    Tests skip with `@@skip -- go is one-color`.

[h] **Erlang** — actor model + selective receive replaces async/await;
    "one-color" in the same sense as Go. Async tests skip.

[i] **Erlang** — the self-call transition guard is implemented via
    `gen_statem`'s native state-machine semantics rather than the
    `_transitioned` flag the other 16 backends use. After
    `frame_dispatch__`, generated code wraps the post-call
    statements in a `case Data#data.frame_current_state of
    <pre-call-state> -> [post-call code]; _ -> {next_state, ...}
    end` short-circuit. Functional contract identical (post-call
    code does not run after a transitioning self-call); structurally
    divergent (no `_transitioned` flag, no
    `if _context_stack[-1]._transitioned: return` shape).
    Implemented in `erlang_wrap_self_call_guards`
    (`framec/.../erlang_system.rs:1411-1589`); codegen's
    `generate_self_call_guard` returns empty for Erlang
    (`framec/.../frame_expansion.rs:4752`). The divergence is
    intentional — keeping `gen_statem` idioms is preferred over
    structural sameness. See `docs/erlang_alignment_requirements.md`
    in the framepiler repo for the path-to-alignment if structural
    consistency becomes a requirement.

[j] **Java** — Java requires one public class per file, so a
    file with multiple `@@system` declarations is rejected by
    framec with E407. Cross-system field instantiation
    (`level = @@Other()`) works fine when each `@@system` lives
    in its own file. Multi-system test fixtures (demos 20, 28,
    29, 33; primary 39, 50, 52) carry `@@skip` for `.fjava` and
    are exercised on the other 15 backends instead.

[k] **Erlang** — Erlang requires one module per file, so a file
    with multiple `@@system` declarations is rejected by framec
    with E406. Cross-system field instantiation isn't currently
    wired for Erlang either: a `level = @@Other()` field would
    need a `gen_statem:start_link/{1,3}` invocation in the parent
    module's init, plus PID-based message routing instead of
    direct method calls. Phase 7's multi-system fuzz harness
    excludes Erlang for the same reason. Demos 20, 28, 29, 33
    and frame_machines/state_var_parser carry `@@skip` for
    `.ferl` and are exercised on the other 15 backends.

[l] **C** — C has no native list/vector type. Frame's domain
    fields with `: list` annotations require a runtime list
    helper that framec doesn't currently ship for C. Demo 21
    (worker_pool) skips on `.fc` because the source uses
    `self.pending: list`. The other 16 backends use their
    native list/array type.

[m] **Erlang** — Frame's `while` keyword is target-language
    native passthrough; framec emits the keyword verbatim into
    handler bodies. Erlang has no `while` keyword (functional
    language; iteration uses recursion or list comprehensions),
    so a Frame source written with `while cond { ... }` won't
    compile under Erlang. The 4 control_flow / systems while-
    loop fixtures (`while_forward_then_native.ferl`,
    `while_forward_then_transition_exec.ferl`,
    `while_inline_forward_then_transition_exec.ferl`,
    `while_inline_forward_stack_then_transition_exec.ferl`)
    skip on `.ferl`.

## Test corpus coverage

Every capability marked ✅ above is exercised by an executable test
under `tests/common/positive/`. The matrix-runner enforces these
across every language at every commit; see `make test` from
`docker/`.

The cascade tests (46–48), parameter-propagation test (49), the
HSM state-arg propagation test (52), and the forward-transition
tests (19, 29) are the canonical conformance gates for the HSM
additions in v4. Erlang's `.ferl` variants run through a sidecar
driver convention (commit 5786312, 2026-04-27): if a
`<test>.driver.escript` exists alongside `<test>.ferl`,
`erlang_batch.sh` copies it to `run_test.escript` and uses it
instead of the auto-generated smoke-test driver. Tests 39, 47,
48, 49, 53 currently ship assertion-based drivers covering
self-call return-value propagation, HSM enter/exit cascade order
with parameter propagation, sibling transition under shared
parent, and the post-self-call transition guard. Tests without a
sidecar fall back to the smoke-test driver (call every export,
no ordering check).

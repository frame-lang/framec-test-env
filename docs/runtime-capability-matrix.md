spec). Generated from a manual audit on 2026-04-26.

## Legend

- ✅ — fully implemented per spec

## Footnotes

[a] **Erlang** — built on `gen_statem` (OTP) instead of a custom
    kernel. The shape is different (state functions, not a router),
    but the semantic surface (`@@:return`, `@@:data`, lifecycle
    routing, transitions) is mapped onto the platform.

[b] **Erlang** — domain fields live on the `#data{}` record threaded
    through `gen_statem` callbacks. Reads/writes look like
    `Data#data.x` rather than `self.x`.

[c] **Erlang** — exit args populate `frame_exit_args` on the data
    record. `frame_exit_dispatch__` walks the HSM chain bottom-up
    and calls each layer's `frame_exit__<state>` helper, so child
    `<$` handlers fire and receive their declared params via
    positional extraction from the args map.

[f] **Java** — Frame async lowers to `CompletableFuture` in
    principle but isn't fully wired (`make_system_async` has a
    placeholder for Java). Existing Java tests don't exercise async.

[g] **Go** — async goroutines aren't supported via `@@async`;
    Go's concurrency model is goroutines + channels, which doesn't
    map cleanly onto the kernel-callback structure framec uses.
    Tests skip with `@@skip -- go is one-color`.

[h] **Erlang** — actor model + selective receive replaces async/await;
    "one-color" in the same sense as Go. Async tests skip.

[i] **Erlang** — the self-call transition guard is implemented via
    `gen_statem`'s native state-machine semantics rather than the
    `_transitioned` flag the other 16 backends use. After
    `frame_dispatch__`, generated code wraps the post-call
    statements in a `case Data#data.frame_current_state of
    <pre-call-state> -> [post-call code]; _ -> {next_state, ...}
    end` short-circuit. Functional contract identical (post-call
    code does not run after a transitioning self-call); structurally
    divergent (no `_transitioned` flag, no
    `if _context_stack[-1]._transitioned: return` shape).
    Implemented in `erlang_wrap_self_call_guards`
    (`framec/.../erlang_system.rs:1411-1589`); codegen's
    `generate_self_call_guard` returns empty for Erlang
    (`framec/.../frame_expansion.rs:4752`). The divergence is
    intentional — keeping `gen_statem` idioms is preferred over
    structural sameness. See `docs/erlang_alignment_requirements.md`
    in the framepiler repo for the path-to-alignment if structural
    consistency becomes a requirement.

## Summary

| Bucket | Conformance |
|---|---|
| Languages fully conformant to v4 spec | 17 / 17 |
| Languages with HSM cascade implemented | 17 / 17 |
| Known divergence | Erlang self-call guard mechanism ([i], structurally divergent but functional contract met) |
| Language-natural skips | C, Go, PHP, Ruby, Lua, Erlang on async |

## Test corpus coverage

Every capability marked ✅ above is exercised by an executable test
under `tests/common/positive/`. The matrix-runner enforces these
across every language at every commit; see `make test` from
`docker/`.

The cascade tests (46–48), parameter-propagation test (49), the
HSM state-arg propagation test (52), and the forward-transition
tests (19, 29) are the canonical conformance gates for the HSM
additions in v4. Erlang's `.ferl` variants are smoke-test
stand-ins — they verify the system runs and that expected strings
appear in the domain log, but don't assert exact trace ordering.
The underlying cascade and forward-re-dispatch are implemented
per spec (`framec_native_codegen/erlang_system.rs`:
`frame_enter__<state>` helpers, `frame_exit_dispatch__` chain
walk, `frame_forward_transition__` with `next_event`-action
re-dispatch); upgrading the `.ferl` tests to assert ordering
would require a per-test escript driver convention that the
matrix runner doesn't currently support.
